## 🏛 Taxonomy of IQA Methods

IQA methods can be categorized based on their dependency on reference images:

- **Full-Reference IQA (FR-IQA)**: Requires a pristine reference image for comparison.
- **Reduced-Reference IQA (RR-IQA)**: Uses partial reference information for assessment.
- **No-Reference IQA (NR-IQA)**: Assesses image quality without any reference image.

## 🛠 Key Techniques and Methodologies

### 📊 Traditional IQA Metrics
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
- Visual Information Fidelity (VIF)

### 🤖 Learning-Based IQA
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models
- Transformer-based IQA models
- No-reference deep learning methods

### 🏗 Hybrid Approaches
- Combining statistical and deep learning-based techniques
- Multi-scale feature extraction for perceptual quality assessment

## 🚀 Applications

IQA methods are widely used in various domains, including but not limited to:

- **Image Compression and Enhancement**
- **Medical Imaging Quality Assessment**
- **Autonomous Driving and Surveillance**
- **Multimedia Streaming and Transmission**
- **Photo Editing and Aesthetic Assessment**

## ⚠ Challenges and Open Problems

Despite advancements, IQA faces several challenges:

- **Subjective vs. Objective Quality Discrepancy**: Bridging the gap between human perception and objective metrics.
- **Generalization and Robustness**: Ensuring model performance across diverse datasets.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Reducing computational overhead for real-time applications.
- **Interpretable and Explainable IQA**: Enhancing transparency in deep learning-based IQA models.

## 🔭 Future Directions

- **Self-Supervised Learning for IQA**: Reducing reliance on labeled datasets.
- **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Improving robustness across different image types.
- **Efficient and Lightweight Models**: Developing IQA methods for resource-constrained devices.
- **Benchmarking and Standardization**: Establishing unified evaluation metrics and datasets.
